To-Fix:
- Video play/stop working (only one), I need to change querySelector for all of them. 
- Alumns-list is filled with info from array document, right now is at the same index.js; for better understanding move to data.js


To-Do:
- Ask for the profile pages design content images, video, etc
- Ask for final design responsive mobile.
- Learn routing system to create +80pages one for each student and route /alumneXX.html
- Functions to classify [X] alumns, [ ] project title, [ ] abstract, [ ] Src route and relate all of them to:
    1. videos
    2. alumns list
